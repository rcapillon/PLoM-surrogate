# PLoM-surrogate
Tools for constructing a surrogate model for a stochastic numerical model using Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds

**Important note**: This code has just recently been made public and is undergoing development and bug-fixing.
Take it as is. For now, the examples in the script directory should be your go-to to make your own surrogate model.
